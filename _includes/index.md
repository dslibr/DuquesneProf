### QSIS 285 Business Statistics

In QSIS 285 Business Statistics, students select and apply appropriate statistical tools and methods to answer questions, solve problems, and make informed, evidence-based decisions. Course topics include descriptive statistics (visual descriptions and summaries of the data using graphs and tables), inferential statistics (hypothesis testing using the normal, t, F, and chi-square distributions), and regression analysis (simple linear and multiple linear regression). Students engaged with these topics through hands-on activities, simulations, and projects. I taught seven sections of QSIS 285 from fall 2016 through summer 2018.

### UCOR 111 Problem Solving

Problem solving involves gathering and organizing information about a problem and planning steps that will lead to a solution to the problem. Steps in the problem solving process can be very different from one problem to the next. The goal of the course, UCOR 111 Problem Solving, was for students to design the gathering, organizing, and planning process for a variety of problems both in collaboration with others and on their own. To help students reach this goal, they practiced many techniques and strategies from statistics and probability, number theory, general mathematical laws, logic, Venn diagrams, and graph theory. In some cases, students generalized solutions to construct mathematical formulas. I taught one section of this course in the spring semester of 2018.

### Math 125 Fundamentals of Statistics

Math 125 Fundamentals of Statistics is a survey course in exploratory data analysis and statistical inference including graphical summaries of data, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. Students engaged with these topics through hands-on activities and projects. I taught one section of this course when I was a student in the Computational Mathematics program at Duquesne University.
